Patterns and algorithms for healthier user experiences

Pseudo and real code when possible. Quantify whenever possible (e.g. 3 beeps, not 2, not 4 and pref none).

- Notifiers
    - [Sounds](sounds.md)
    - typical frequencies and durations=
        - examples
        - algorithms
    - Haptic vibrations
        - typical frequencies and durations
        - examples
        - algorithms
    - Visual
        - use of red/yellow/green
        - cultural differences
    - Are there patterns to what makes something annoying across domains?

- General for now:        
    - Ambiguity when control has 2 states (which is on?)
    - moving a ui element as user trys to select
    - algorithms for pointer movement
    - palm cancellation
    - reflow around user obscuring the screen (like thumb over content)
    - snapping a dragged component to an alignment object (how does dragging a window to the side and having it snap there work?)



- Urgency patterns

- Chart of typical times and durations
    - Ex: startle and recover
    - Ex: how many questions in a row with "ok" as the answer everytime
    - holding dragged items over another item before it "opens". Like dragging files to a new folder - how long to wait on hover before expanding target? what constitutes intention?
    - how is hover intent determined? can you move mouse 1 pixel and the timer doesn't change?

- Large stuff:
    - UX flow for signup/login/forgot with business conditionals

- Breakdowns and analysis of good vs OK design. Maybe some bad design where it _should_ have been good but didn't work for reason X.

- Unpatent:
    - Area where users can document an idea so as to disclose and establish prior art
